Max Whitney: The restaurant will have a local garden. Our page will have a section explaining the farm-to-food process. What is sprayed on the garden? Is it truly vegan? Etc.
The restaurant will be powered by solar panels and wind turbines (and other things if applicable). It will have a vegetable color scheme (mostly green). We’ll have a page open for feedback, a menu, information, etc. 

Name Idea - Ingram because of the Vegan from Scott Pilgrim.

Motto - Being vegan just makes you better than everyone else


Levi Hansen: Tyler Sharpe head chef. All leftover food is turned into compost or given to the homeless. Dominating white and green color scheme like a millennial’s house. Gourmet shrooms harvested from the dead corpse of a cow in the back alley. Vegan restaurants could be named “Unnamed Vegan Restaurant” or “The Garden of Vegan”. Hire a clown or jester named Phelony to be in one of those medieval shackle neck things and have people pay to throw very fresh, massive vegetables (watermelons, watermelons, cucumbers, etc.) or meat at him. 


Khanon Curtis: Secret meat menu named “Carnivore Supremacy” All food is fresh from the live animals we store in the back. Blood-colored color scheme. Kill/Cook your own animal option for $30 extra (also have to pay for supplies) arsenal in the back for killing said animals. Have to sign a waiver to kill/cook. We could call the actual restaurant “Vegans Anonymous” because I would be embarrassed to be a vegan. We can also have everyone wear blindfolds and feed them vegetable-flavored meat
